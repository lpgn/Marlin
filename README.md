## Quick Information

This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups.
It also works on the Ultimaker PCB. It supports printing from SD card+Folders, and look-ahead trajectory planning.
This firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl) and many original parts.

## Current Status: Bug Fixing

## Release Branch

The Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.0.2-1 â€“ January 2015). It also includes a version 1.0.1 (December 2014). Any version of Marlin before 1.0.1 (when we started tagging versions) can be collectively referred to as Marlin 1.0.0.

## Patches - 1.0.x Branch

Any patches developed for this family of releases will be found on the [1.0.x branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.x) of this repository.

## This Repository is Not For Feature Development

Development of future versions of Marlin is ongoing. However, to keep issues separate, that effort takes place in a companion [Development Repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/). Please make all suggestions for future features in that project. Issues raised here should be restricted to errors in the tagged releases.

## Current Status: In Development

Marlin development is being accelerated to catch up with a long list of issues. Check the Issues and Pull Requests links on the right to to see what we are currently working on.

Please do not use this code in products (3D printers, CNC etc) that are closed source or are crippled by a patent.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
